              NYT Connections is a daily word puzzle by The New York Times. Each
              day, you&apos;re presented with <strong>16 words</strong> arranged
              in a 4x4 grid.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your goal is to find <strong>four groups of four words</strong>{" "}
              that share a common connection. The groups are color-coded by
              difficulty from Yellow (easiest) to Purple (hardest).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can make up to <strong>4 mistakes</strong> before the game
              ends. Each incorrect guess (selecting 4 words that don&apos;t form
              a valid group) counts as one mistake.
            </p>
            <p>
              A new puzzle is released every day at midnight Eastern Time. The
              puzzle is the same for everyone worldwide.
