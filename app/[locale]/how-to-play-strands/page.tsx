            <p>
              NYT Strands is a daily word search puzzle by The New York Times.
              Each day, you&apos;re presented with a{" "}
              <strong>6&times;8 grid of letters</strong> and a theme clue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your goal is to find all the <strong>theme words</strong> hidden
              in the grid. Theme words connect to the daily clue and can twist
              and turn in any direction &mdash; horizontally, vertically,
              diagonally, and even changing direction mid-word.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every puzzle includes one special word called the{" "}
              <strong>Spangram</strong> &mdash; a word that spans the entire
              board from one side to the other and captures the puzzle&apos;s
              overall theme.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike other word games, <strong>there are no mistake limits</strong>.
              You can keep searching until you find all the theme words. A new
              puzzle is released every day at midnight Eastern Time.

              To select a word, <strong>tap or click letters</strong> in
